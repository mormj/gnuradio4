# Core Repository Split Preparation

GNU Radio 4 core is split from the original monorepo as `gnuradio4-core` while
preserving its full Git history. Reusable algorithm libraries and standard MIT
block libraries live in external repositories that build against the installed
core SDK.

In this repository:

- core code and public core headers must not depend on `algorithm/` or `blocks/`;
- algorithm code may depend on the installed core SDK;
- standard block libraries may depend on the installed core SDK and algorithm package;
- external blocklib repositories should use the installed `gnuradio4` and
  `GnuRadioBlockLib` CMake packages, including the installed
  `gnuradio_4_0_parse_registrations` tool.

The core repository now builds core-only by default. Validate it with:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-core -DGR_USE_FETCHCONTENT_DEPS=ON -DUSE_CCACHE=OFF
cmake --build build-core
ctest --test-dir build-core --output-on-failure
```

Standard blocks belong in `gnuradio4-blocks`. Reusable non-block DSP algorithm
libraries belong in `gnuradio4-algorithm`. Extracted repositories should build
against the installed core SDK rather than source-tree paths from this
repository.

Standard-block and algorithm-dependent tests and benchmarks that previously lived
under `core/test` and `core/benchmarks` have been removed from this core tree as
normal Git changes. They should be reintroduced in `gnuradio4-blocks`,
`gnuradio4-algorithm`, or a cross-repository integration test suite as
appropriate.

`PluginLoader` currently supports local and `file://` plugin assets in core-only
mode. HTTP(S) plugin asset loading should be reintroduced later through a
core-owned abstraction if it remains required.
